mysql package
============
Mariadb connector

The blob contains mariadb-connector library. It comes from https://downloads.mariadb.org/connector-c/3.0.3/

Mysql

The blob contains two binaries - mysqldump (that was used for backups and can be
deleted) and mysql (that is probably not used). The original blob probably came from
[Percona
site](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-5.7/Percona-Server-5.7.10-3/binary/tarball/Percona-Server-5.7.10-3-Linux.x86_64.ssl100.tar.gz)
and has been repackaged to just include two binaries.
